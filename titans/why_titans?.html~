<h1 align="center">WHY ARE TITANS AT CODE<FONT COLOR="#00ff33"><a href="http://coders.projectcodex.co/">X</FONT>?</h1>

<p>CodeX is a great technological platform to learn about one of the

most demanding technological sectors of Information Technology, Software

Development. Our involvement in the programme took place upon

our deepest fascination in technology as a whole. We are part of

the programme with the hope of acquiring information, hopefully

sufficient, to benefit one self hence contribute in the demand. We

are young and innovative thus such exposure might, possible, lead to

the elimination of unemployment in this country.</p>
We have great passion in operating systems, gadgets, robots and

all new developments as we are leaving in the technological era.

<p>We, therefore, saw the need and became adamant on missing on such opportunity. All that will be

brought forth to our attention, by means of continuous learning, we surely fall in the good hands as

each one has a vision of making a living out of the programme.</p>
